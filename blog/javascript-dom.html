      <h2>JavaScript DOM</h2>
      <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
      <p>In simple terms, the DOM is a bunch of little packages that are organised in a way so that a computer can understand what is there. It represents a webpage in objects (little boxes) and programmers can use computer languages to manipulate those objects. </p>
      <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a family tree, in which every HTML element is considered a parent, sibling or child element. For example:</p>
      
      <pre class="code-block">
        <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;

          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;body&gt;

          &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="An image"&gt;
          &lt;button>Click Me&lt;/button&gt;

        &lt;/body&gt;

        &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
      </div>
      <p>The &lt;html&gt; tag is the root of the tree, and it has child elements such as &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. Then, the &lt;body&gt; element has other child elements like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;button&gt;. Each of these elements is a “node” in the DOM.</p>
      <img src="./images/DOM example.png" class="dom-tree-example">
      <p>Programmers use JavaScript to manipulate those “nodes” inside the DOM, changing their content, modifying their attributes, adding or removing elements dynamically, and responding to user interaction such as clicks or form submissions.</p>
    
      <h2>JavaScript HTML and CSS</h2>
        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that gives us tools to manipulate the structure and the behaviour of a webpage. It can make the page more dynamic and act the way we want it to behave. For example, we can create a button that changes the size or content of a paragraph. JavaScript also “remembers” things because we can create variables and functions that store information so we can use it as many times as we want.</p>  
         <div class="test-button1">
        <button>Click me!</button> 
        <p class="in-line-button">This button doesn't do anything because there is no JavaScript telling it what to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="test-button2">
          <button id="countButton">Click me!</button>
          <p class="in-line-button">This button can count!!! => <span id="countDisplay">0</span></p>
        </div>

        <h3>HTML CSS and JavaScript - How do they connect?</h3>
        <p>If a website was an orchestra, HTML and CSS would be the musicians and their instruments. JavaScript would be the conductor, guiding the different elements on a page to work together whenever they are asked to do something.</p>
        <p>If a website was a recipe, HTML and CSS would be the ingredients and their flavours. JavaScript would be the instructions, so your recipe can be repeated over and over, and still have the same outcome.</p>
        <p>If a website was a sports team, HTML and CSS would be the players and their different positions in the playing field. JavaScript would be the coach that will organise, strategise, and guide players through a match so they can achieve their goals.</p.>
        
        <h3>Control flow and Loops in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript works in a specific order and things have to be coded (written) in a way that the computer will understand and execute the lines of code the way we wanted. The code in JavaScript is run from the first line in the file to the last line. But we can control this workflow and, to change this flow, we can use conditionals and loops.</p>
        <p>For example,  we can use JavaScript to calculate the total price of a shopping cart, creating a loop that goes through every element, takes their individual prices, and sums everything.</p>
        <pre class="code-block"> 
        <code>
          // Define the function
          function calculateTotalPrice(items) {
            let totalPrice = 0;
  
          // Loop through each item in the shopping cart
          for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
            // Get the price of the current item
            let itemPrice = items[i].price;
            
            // Add the price to the total
            totalPrice += itemPrice;
          }
  
            // Return the total price
            return totalPrice;
          }


          // Create an array of items in the shopping cart
          const cartItems = [
            { name: 'Shirt', price: 20 },
            { name: 'Pants', price: 30 },
            { name: 'Shoes', price: 50 }
          ];


          // Call the calculateTotalPrice function with the cart items
          const total = calculateTotalPrice(cartItems);


          // Print the total price
          console.log('Total price:', total);

         </code>
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Arrays and Objects in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>When it comes to structure, arrays are an ordered collection of elements that can be accessed by its numeric index. The index starts from 0 (zero) for the first element.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">

          const myArr = [position0, position1, position2, position3…]
        </pre>

        <p>We can access any position using the numeric index.</p>

        <pre class="code-block">

          myArr[0] // This will have the value 'position0' stored there.
        </pre>

        <p>Objects don’t have a specific order, but have a specific key that can be a word or a symbol.</p>

        <pre class="code-block">

          const person = {
            name: ‘John’,
            age: 32,
            mail: ‘john@email.com’ 
            }
        </pre>

        <p>We can access the values using the “dot” notation for objects.</p>

        <pre class="code-block">

          person.name // This will have “John” stored there.
        </pre>

        <p>Both Arrays and Objects can store any data type. The difference will be the way we will access the data stored, as seen above.</p>
        <p>To iterate with Arrays, there are built-in methods like “forEach” and “map”. Objects will require additional steps like creating a “for…in” loop or “Object.keys”.</p>
        <p>Basically, Arrays are more useful for storing and accessing ordered collections of data, while objects are best for organising and accessing data based on specific keys or properties.</p>

        <h3>Functions in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Functions are mini, reusable pieces of a program. Having functions in your code will help it be more:</p>
        <ul class="function-list">
          <li>Organised -  Instead of having all the code in one big chunk, you can divide it into smaller, logical units represented by functions.</li>
          <li>Modular -  Functions allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Each function can focus on a specific subtask, making the overall code more modular and easier to work with. You can also combine multiple functions together to achieve more complex functionalities.</li>
          <li>Abstract - You can encapsulate a series of operations or a complex algorithm within a function and give it a meaningful name. This abstraction hides the implementation details, allowing you to work with higher-level concepts and make your code more intuitive and readable.</li>
        </ul>
