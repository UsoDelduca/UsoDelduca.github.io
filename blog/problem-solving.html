      <h1>Problem-solving and its journey</h1>
      <p>
        In this post, I will share some of my experiences while attempting to
        solve problems.
      </p>
      <h2>How I almost had my mind blown by a problem</h2>
      <p>
        I'm going to tell a story about a little problem I had to solve a few
        weeks ago. The problem was related to a JavaScript code where I had to
        add functionalities to mouse buttons while navigating a webpage. For
        instance, clicking an element on the page with the left button once
        would change the color of that element to blue, clicking with the right
        button would change the color to green, and finally, double-clicking
        with the left button would make the element "invisible." I searched for
        solutions online and found some interesting and straightforward ones. I
        chose one of them and wrote the code on my page. I checked the page, and
        the buttons changed the color to blue when clicked with the left button.
        I repeated the process for the green color, but when I tested it,
        nothing happened! Even worse, when I clicked with the right button, the
        mouse opened the page's options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I had a problem, and I didn't exactly know what my problem was. I
        went to the Discord group and asked if someone could help me out. A
        colleague offered to assist and showed me their page with all the
        functionalities working perfectly. It was then that I realized my
        problem wasn't with the code, but rather with the way it was being
        "rendered" on my end. I left the conversation, reopened my page, and
        this time, I didn't open the "console" of the browser. The console is a
        part of your browser where you can check if the codes you write are
        working correctly or if there are any errors. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <img src="./images/console-sample.png" class="problem-solving-images" />
      <p>
        It wasn't easy to realize that the problem wasn't what I initially
        thought it was. The whole process was time-consuming and, in a way,
        painful. I learned that Google Chrome, when the console is open, isn't
        100% reliable in some specific cases like this. I also learned that even
        though the problem may seem simple, it can give us a big headache!
        Remember, problem-solving can be a challenging journey, and sometimes
        the solution lies in unexpected places. The key is to keep an open mind,
        seek help when needed, and persevere until you find the root cause and
        resolve the issue.
      </p>

      <h2>How I solved a problem in an "elegant" way</h2>

      <p>
        After struggling for a while to solve a particular problem, I thought I
        had mastered the essence of it. However, that couldn't be further from
        the truth. Learning to solve problems takes time and usually comes with
        a lot of headaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't feel that I have been able to solve any problem in an "elegant"
        way, but I believe that stepping back and gaining a better perspective
        often leads to quicker results. When facing a programming-related issue,
        my first stop is usually Google. If I can't find a straightforward and
        understandable solution, I move on to the next step, which is asking
        ChatGPT for help. The answers are interesting, but sometimes the content
        can be a bit confusing. The next step is refining the question prompt
        until a reasonable response appears. If it's still unclear, I turn to
        the Discord groups for further assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I liked most during this process is that the way I approach a
        question is changing, and I am learning to search for a solution more
        effectively. The problem may still be there, but the path to finding a
        potential solution is becoming less convoluted
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, problem-solving is an evolving skill, and each challenge you
        encounter helps you refine your approach and become a more efficient
        problem-solver over time. Embrace the learning process and keep up the
        great work!
      </p>

      <h2>Reflections on problem-solving techniques</h2>

      <p>
        The techniques I've been using to solve problems are writing pseudocode,
        reading error messages, explaining the issue to myself with drawings in
        my notebook, utilizing Google, ChatGPT, and seeking help from colleagues
        and facilitators.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've previously pointed out, asking for help from others requires a
        certain level of maturity and humility. Some people might find it
        challenging to ask for assistance due to cultural factors or a fear of
        feeling inferior. However, it's essential to recognize that seeking help
        is not a sign of weakness but a valuable skill in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, I may have tried to solve problems alone without sharing
        the situation with others, which could lead to missed opportunities for
        assistance. Opening up to others and seeking their input can be
        immensely beneficial, as it allows me to tap into a collective knowledge
        pool and gain new perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've becvome more inquisitive since I left my country in 2012, and being
        part of a supportive community where others are willing to help is
        indeed a great relief. I'll remember that collaboration and seeking
        guidance from others can lead to more efficient problem-solving and
        continuous learning, making me a stronger and more resourceful problem
        solver. I'll keep up the positive attitude towards problem-solving and
        my openness to learn from others!
