      What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
      positioning?
    </h2>
    <!-- Source: https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/ -->
    <h3>Position: relative</h3>
    <p>
      If the position is set to <b>relative</b>, you should give some more
      positioning attributes (top, right, bottom, left), otherwise it would have
      <b>no effect at all!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if the position is set to <b>relative</b> AND we also add a
      <i>top: 10px</i>, it will shift the position 10px down from where it would
      normally be. And that is awesome! We can fix positioning between things
      using this CSS method.
    </p>
    <h3>Position: absolute</h3>
    <p>
      If the position is set to <b>absolute</b>, the element gets out of the
      flow of the page and can overlap other elements. It is as if it does not
      have limits. You can add top, right, bottom and left attributes to place
      this element wherever you want in the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      An element with <i>position: absolute</i>; is positioned relative to the
      nearest positioned ancestor. But, if there is no parent/ancestor, it will
      use the document body, and moves along with the page scrolling. There is a
      very useful YouTube video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6UgYq3J3Qs">here</a> that shows
      how it works.
    </p>

    <h3>Position: fixed</h3>
    <p>
      If the position is set to <b>fixed</b>, the element is fixed relative to
      the <i>viewport</i>, or the browser window. When a fixed positioned object
      is in the page, it will be there even when the screen is scrolled. It can
      be very useful if you want a menu to be visible at all times.
