      <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to have a job that can help me achieve things in
        life. I’d like to give back to my wife the opportunity to study
        something as she is doing with me right now. With that said, I hope I
        can land a job early 2024, learn enough to get a better position in 2 or
        3 years and then see where life takes me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would describe myself as a “trained student” because I can follow
        instructions and meet deadlines with some ease, but I find it hard to
        try to learn something on my own when there is no clear goal or
        deadline. And I need a learning routine, like, waking up, having
        breakfast, going to “school”, learning, going back home, and resting.
        Repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d like to see how my leadership skills will develop. It is easy to be
        a leader when you are teaching because you are the obvious choice, but
        as a team of equals in a work environment is something entirely
        different. Also, I was told I have good leadership skills, I just didn’t
        believe that much in that statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I would like to manage my workload is by starting early every
        week to get as much time learning as possible. If I get stuck, there
        will be plenty of time to ask for help and work on solutions to the
        problem. Everyday, the first thing I do when I turn my laptop on is to
        check for messages and replies. If there is something I can do to help,
        I will answer and follow up later in the day. Using the Toggl app, I am
        able to track the amount of time I spend on each task and I don’t
        normally spend more than 1 hour on each task. I normally use break times
        to check on messages and ask for help when needed. If things start to
        get to me, I’ll have to stop everything and reorganize things in my head
        and my schedule. A good break away from the screen is a starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I’ll double-check my work to see if I can identify the issue and
        correct it. Then, I’ll check online to see if there is an easy solution
        to my problem. If I can’t find or can’t understand what the solution is,
        I’ll ask for help in the community. As I mentioned before, I like to get
        things done as early as possible to avoid stress later in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect the Facilitators to have a good time helping us! And I don’t
        expect them to be ninjas in all subjects, but knowledgeable enough to
        help us, and to be good listeners because we all get frustrated at some
        point in this journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan to have early starts so I can have early finishes because I need
        to get my physical and mental health sorted at the gym, or running. So,
        I commit to working and actively helping others during “normal” working
        hours.
