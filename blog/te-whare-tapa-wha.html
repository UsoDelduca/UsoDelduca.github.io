    <h2>What is Te whare tapa whā?</h2>
    <p>
      The definition can be found at
      <a
        href="https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/t/te-whare-tapa-wha-and-wellbeing/"
        >Healthify NZ</a
      >, and it is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing developed by Sir
      Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on health. The 4
      dimensions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</li>
      <li>taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</li>
      <li>taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li>
      <li>taha whānau (family wellbeing)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With 4 walls, the wharenui (meeting house) is a symbol of these 4
      dimensions. The wharenui’s connection with the whenua (land) forms the
      foundation for the other 4 dimensions.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of new things for me there and I’ll try to make progress
        and add little things to my routine. Coming from a different cultural
        background with different beliefs is the main challenge now. How to
        integrate these findings to who I am? How do I connect with a land that
        I have been part of for only 5 years? I guess I’ll find out. In time…
